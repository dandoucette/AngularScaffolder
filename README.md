# AngularScaffolder
App to scaffold some angular code based on C# model objects

## Purpose

I found when writing angular apps I was doing a lot of tedious typing that could be automated.  I would create an entity in my C# API then recreating that exact object in TypeScript as an interface.  I thought why not create a little tool that could read in a class, parse out the properties and create an interface.  

I started looking into creating somewhat strongly typed reactive forms and material tables so I whipped up some code to create that as well. Finally I added an API service creator that would just wire up CRUD functionality.

It is early in it's life but I'd like to add more stuff as I go along to make my life easier.  I'd rather spend time figuring out hard stuff rather than typing in the tedious stuff.
